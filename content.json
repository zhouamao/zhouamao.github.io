However, the harsh and complex environment on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) poses great challenges for both in situ observation and remote sensing monitoring of the soil freeze-thaw process. In this paper, the spatiotemporal variation of the high-resolution time-series of Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is analyzed for identifying the freeze-thaw state of the soil. The scattering, including intensity and decomposition parameters, and coherence, are analyzed with regions of interests (ROIs) of different landcover types. The second-order and fourth-order Fourier functions are used to fit the scattering and coherence time-series, respectively, to build the mathematical models of SAR features over time. Based on those models, the initial freeze-thaw times of the soil are detected, and the corresponding map can be given. The results are cross-validated with the initial freeze-thaw time of the soil obtained from the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products, showing that the difference in days is less than one revisit cycle of Sentinel-1. Furthermore, the environmental factors acquired from the meteorological station, including air temperature, ground surface temperature, snow depth, and precipitation, are discussed for evaluating the possible impact on scattering and coherence. This finding has shown that Sentinel-1 has great potential for soil freeze-thaw monitoring, which can obtain soil freeze-thaw state with a high spatial-temporal resolution and provides the start and end time of the active layer freeze-thaw process indirectly.

In this paper, a practical plateau lake extraction algorithm combining novel statistical features and Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) using SAR imagery has been proposed. Firstly, a mathematical description for the plateau lake surface called object-based generalized gamma distribution (OGD) features has been proposed, which is able to suppress the false alarms by using spatial context information as the large-scale descriptor. Secondly, the random forest (RF) classifier is used to train a multi-feature set, including conventional texture features and OGD features, and output an initial labeling result. Finally, to suppress the false alarms in the initial lake extraction results, automatic post-processing based on KLD has been used. The algorithm is tested by several experiments using Sentinel-1 SAR data, performing better than the state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving the overall accuracy (OA) of 99.54% while maintaining a false-alarm rate (FR) of 0.32%.
